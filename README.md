Script to check for vulnerable status of CVE-2020-3952

It is inspired from [guardicore
exploit](https://github.com/guardicore/vmware_vcenter_cve_2020_3952)
but with a slight difference: it does NOT create an admin user.

It will assess the vulnerable status by validating that the builtin
Administrators group can be tainted by creating or appending the
harmless 'description' attribute.

Usage:
```
$ python exploit_check.py vserver_ip
```
